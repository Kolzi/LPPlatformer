Fix:
-initialize default component values in constructor, not in read
-initialize required component values in xml-contructor to NULL or something
-check in read if the node is empty and value is NULL and then throw exception
-add possibility to set EID in XML
-probably systems (and ArchetypesManager) should take Level as argument, not maps of components ???

Add:
-sound system
-object orientation (angle)
